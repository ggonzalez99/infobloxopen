# infobloxopen

Language: GO

IDE: GoLand

GIT: Github Desktop (UI)

(Still ambitious about CLI. Although, the UI was very helpful in productivity and efficiency)

Recurring errors using CLI: Outdated origin/ rejected to push

Solution: Deleted repository and created a new one without the README

Questions: How can I connect to existing Infoblox repos via CLI?
